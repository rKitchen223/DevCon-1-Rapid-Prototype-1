**DevCon #1: Rapid Prototype**

**Define the desired game mechanic or feature:**

The core mechanics involves guiding a frog through obstacles and platforms by excuting while timing jumps. How it works, a player hits a button, and the frog leaps at variable speed as game progresses.

Jumping or leaping is use to overcome obstacles but in our design we have gravitational platforms.

We are making a 2D dash mechanic game that has a 2D frog as the character where he jumps from platform to platform reaching at the end of the goal in the game. The leap being the dash mechanic of the game and it fades into making a shadow clone of the character.

**Objective Statement:**

**Questions:** How does momentum through players positioning adds depth to dashing mechanics?

The player leaping mechanic would have a timer ability to set the depth mechanic of the frog character which would show the player last movement mechanic to reach the end once they finish the obstacle course. It will show the position of the player in which on how far the frog leaps to one platform to another.

**Detail Design Rationale:**

Transforming the leap mechanic introduces a skill-based diffculty layer, making the gameplay more dynamic. It creates a sense of timing your leaps and jumps to make the game more diffcult to complete and trying to jump to each of the obstacles.
