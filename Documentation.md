DevCon #1: Rapid Prototype
Objective Statement:
What are you trying to answer with this prototype?
•	This prototype discusses the way in which dashing can be enhanced with momentum through player positioning.
•	It experiments with the possibility of making the leaping and dashing movement of a frog more skill-based with timing and positioning.
•	It also shows the impact of the gravitational platforms and changing speeds of the dash on the difficulty of achieving the final target.

Design Rationale:
Experience Envisioned:
This design is intended to make the player feel that they have a sense of timing, agility and accuracy when navigating a frog through the platforms. Players have to be keen when timing their leaps and dashes otherwise, they will fail in their way to the goal.
Innovative/Experimental Aspects:
•	Mechanic Depth: There is the overlay of momentum and positioning, which influences the distance and success of every dash.

•	Timer Feedback System: The last movement of the frog is recorded by a timer-based mechanic which is displayed after the obstacle course is cleared. This emphasizes accuracy and play consistency.

•	Visual Design Choice: The frog disappears after every dash, which supports the leap as a mechanic and provides a visual addition.

•	Skill-Based Difficulty: The leap mechanic turns jumping in a dynamic and skill-based challenge in which precision and timing becomes more challenging the further you get into the game.
Resource Citation:
•	Tangible Resources: 2D Frog character sprite, gravitational platforms, shadow clone effect.
•	Educational Resources: Concepts of momentum, positioning, and timing used in platformer and dash-based mechanics.
•	Transformative Resources: Adjustments of leap mechanics into a timing-based difficulty system.
